    Transfers
    Transfers are records of transactions made within an investment account’s asset pool. This can be in the form of records of:
    
    Fund transfer from wallet to investments
    Investment liquidation into a user’s wallet
    Investment dividend payouts into a user’s wallet
    Transfers between users’ wallets (The Embed API also makes provision for P2P (peer-to-peer) transfers, that is transfers from one user’s wallet to another user's wallet within your platform.)
    Below is a sample Transfers object.
